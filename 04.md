## Problem

The files are getting a bit too big. We want to break them up into smaller chunks to make them easier for the Cursor agent to understand.

## Supporting Information

We have two concepts in the repo: `tools` and `github-functions`.

- `github-functions` are the way that we connect to GitHub
- `tools` are the things that get attached to the MCP server. `tools` contain `github-functions`.

We want to break up the large files we have into smaller chunks, using a file structure which reflects the relationship between `tools` and `github-functions`.

## Steps To Complete

- Break up the large files into smaller chunks, using the file structure above.

- Each file may contain multiple `github-functions` or `tools`, but they should be split by domain.

- Ensure that all major files are added to the `.cursor/rules/important-files.mdc` file.
