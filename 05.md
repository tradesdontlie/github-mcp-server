## Problem

I want to be able to check the status of actions on the MCP server.

## Supporting Information

Always ensure that `page` and `per_page` are included in the request parameters, even if the API doesn't require them.

## Steps To Complete

- Look at the existing implementations of functions and tools in the correct directory. Load them into your context window.

- Add functions to:

  - List the actions in a repository.
  - Get the status of an action.
  - Get the details of an action.
  - Cancel an action.
  - Retry an action.

- Add those functions as tools to the MCP server.

- Ensure that all major files are added to the `.cursor/rules/important-files.mdc` file.
